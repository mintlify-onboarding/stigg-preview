Stigg gives engineering teams fine tuned control over what can be packaged and priced separately, so that product and GTM teams can rapidly tweak, test and roll-out changes with no-code.  

## Platform overview

Stigg is a [highly available and scalable](/docs/high-availability-architecture) pricing and packaging orchestration platform. Using Stigg you can:

1. Define what functionality of your product will be monetized
2. Define and continuously adapt your products' packaging (plans, add-ons) and pricing (freemium, trial, usage-based, etc.)
3. Manage customers, their subscriptions, and their usage of your product's' features
4. Render pricing tables and paywalls to customers
5. Render self-served customer portals and checkout forms to customers
6. Propagate changes to business applications (billing, CRM, CMS, etc.)

All of these changes can be achieved in no-code after a short integration process with your application's codebase.
