## Overview

In this quick start guide we'll demonstrate how to create a customer portal using Stigg's embeddable widgets.

Stigg's customer portal widget allows you to introduce self-service and drive in-app expansions using only a few lines of codes.

The customer portal:

1. Provides customers with visibility to their current subscription details - subscribed plan, purchased add-ons, granted promotional entitlements.
2. Provides customers with visibility to the usage of their subscription's features.
3. Allows customers to upgrade and downgrade their subscription in a self-served manner - when you update your pricing model in Stigg, customers will auto-magically be able to upgrade or downgrade their subscription according to the updated pricing model ðŸ˜Ž.
4. Allows customers to view their billing and payment information - when Stigg is integrated with a billing solution (such as Stripe), customers can also update this information and view previous invoices directly from the billing solution's billing portal.

## Before we begin

In order to complete this guide in your application code, please make sure that you have:

* [Modeled your pricing in Stigg](modeling-your-pricing)
* [Installed the Stigg React client SDK](react-sdk#installing-the-sdk)
* [A Stigg **client** API key](javascript-sdk#retrieving-the-client-api-key)
  
## Initializing the React SDK

The first step is to initialize Stigg's React SDK with the client API key by wrapping your application with StiggProvider component.

React

`import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import { StiggProvider } from '@stigg/react-sdk';
import App from './App';

ReactDOM.render(
  <StiggProvider apiKey="YOUR_CLIENT_API_KEY">
    <App />
  </StiggProvider>,
  document.getElementById('app'),
);
`
