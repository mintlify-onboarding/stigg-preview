title: "Exporting data from Stigg"
---

At Stigg we believe that you have full ownership of your data, and therefore allow you to export it at all times.

In order to support you in this process, we've created a repository, which demonstrates the process of exporting data from Stigg, including:

* Product catalog  
   * [Features](features)  
   * [Products](products)  
   * [Plans](plans)  
   * [Add-ons](add-ons)  
   * [Coupons](coupons)
* [Customers](customers)
* [Subscriptions](subscriptions)

The repository includes a script, which uses a GraphQL client to fetch data from Stigg's API and writes the results to JSON files. 

You can change the GraphQL queries according to data you with to export.
