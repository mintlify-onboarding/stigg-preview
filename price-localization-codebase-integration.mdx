title: "Implementing price localization on your public website and application"
---

## Overview

In order to future-proof your public website and application for price localization, it's recommended to implement these changes as part of your initial integration with Stigg.

Doing so will allow you to introduce and rollout changes to the price localization configuration, without requiring any additional code changes.

> ## ðŸš§
> 
> 1. When no localized pricing is defined for a specified country, the default pricing will be used.
> 2. If the customer has already subscribed to a plan with a localized price, its billing country code would **override** the one that's provided programatically.

## Visibility for localized prices in your public pricing page

React

`// fetch the billingCountryCode according to the visitor's IP

<Paywall
  highlightedPlanId="plan-id"
	billingCountryCode="DK" // must be in the ISO-3166-1 format
  onPlanSelected={({ plan, customer }) => {
    // Handle customer intention to subscribe to plan
  }}
/>
`

### In-app paywall

<Paywall
  highlightedPlanId="plan-id"
	billingCountryCode="DK" // must be in the ISO-3166-1 format
  onPlanSelected={({ plan, customer }) => {
    // Handle customer intention to subscribe to plan

## Provisioning subscriptions with localized pricing

Node.js

`// fetch billingCountryCode according to the customer's IP, billing address, etc.

const subscription = await stiggClient.provisionSubscription({  
    customerId: "customer-demo-01",  
    planId: "plan-basic",
    unitQuantity: 2,								// optional, required for subscriptions with per-unit pricing  
    billingPeriod: "MONTHLY", 				// optional, relevant only for paid subscriptions  
    addons: [{  										// optional
        addonId: "addon-10-campaigns",  
        quantity: 1,  
    }],  
    billingCountryCode: "DK",     		// must be in the ISO-3166-1 format
    awaitPaymentConfirmation: true,
    ...
});
