#### Integrate once and never worry about pricing changes

Stigg's snap-in widgets auto-magically sync with the pricing mode that's defined in the Stigg app. When rolling out changes to your pricing, the changes are immediately reflected in the snap-in widgets - no additional code changes required! ðŸ¤¯

#### Widgets for your application and public website

Stigg's snap-in widgets can be integrated into your application and public website. This ensures that the same pricing that's communicated to customers on your public website is also the experience that your customers will see inside your application.
