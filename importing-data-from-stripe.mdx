Stigg's native integration with Stripe streamlines various processes, providing an automated and efficient experience without having to switch constantly between the platforms. More information about the integration can be found [here](/docs/stripe).

As part of this integration, you may want to import data from Stripe to integrate and manage it solely on Stigg. The entities that can be imported are (1) Products and/or (2) Customers and Subscriptions. You can click "Skip step" under Products if you are interested in importing only clients and subscription.

Here's how you can do this with simply 3 steps:

1. Under Integrations > Apps > Stripe, click "Import data from Stripe":

Once done, the imported entities with be managed on Stigg and any changes made will be reflected in the corresponding Stripe account.

> ## ðŸ“˜
> * Currently, only plans with one billable metric can be imported, for example flat fee, in-advance commitment with one metric, pay-as-you-go.
> 
> * Note that the imported entities will be identified_by their Stripe ID_. Importing customers and subscriptions using a different ID can be achieved using our [CLI tool](/docs/bulk-import-of-existing-customers-and-subscriptions-into-stigg#import-using-our-cli-tool).
