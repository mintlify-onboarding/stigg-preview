### Plans with compatible add-ons

In order to rollout price localization for plans with compatible add-on, first add and publish the localized prices for the add-on, and only then rollout the localized prices for the plan.

  
## Visibility for localized prices

### At the plan and add-on level

When price localization is defined for the plan or add-on, localized prices will appear under their "Price" section. Use the "Price localization" drop-down to view the price in each country.

## Creating and updating subscriptions

When a customer has never subscribed to a paid subscription, in the "Create subscription" screen after a paid plan is selected you can select the relevant price localization pricing:

When a customer had a previous subscription, due to [Stripe's limitation](https://support.stripe.com/questions/setting-a-customers-default-currency), it's only possible to select a price localization configuration with the same currency as the one of the currently active subscription:

## Removing localized prices

Localized prices of plans can be removed only if no subscription was created using these prices.

Click on the trash icon that appears in the row of the localized price that you'd like to remove.

Click "Save changes".

Publish the plan or add-on version.

### Plans with compatible add-ons

In order to remove price localization from add-ons that are compatible with plans, first remove the localized price from the plan and publish the changes, and only then rollout the localized prices for the add-on.
