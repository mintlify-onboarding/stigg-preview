title: "Localized billing"
---

When Stigg is integrated with a billing solution (such as [Stripe](stripe)) and customers are subscribed to plan with localized prices, customers will be billed in the same currency that's defined for the localized price. This includes: invoicing, payment collection and receipt generation.

## Invoices

Customer invoices are generated in the currency that's defined in the localized price:

## Payment collection

Customers are billed in their local currency. The collected funds are then converted to your account's currency in the billing provider.
