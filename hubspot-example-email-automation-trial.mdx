title: "Example - email automation for trial subscriptions"
---

## Overview

One of the main benefits of the HubSpot CRM platform is that allows you to automate marketing emails to customers. When Stigg is integrated with HubSpot, data from Stigg can be used to trigger these automations.

A common use-case is to notify customers before their trial subscription expires, upon trial expiration and shortly afterwards. Such emails can help remind customers about the value that they received from the product, and increase conversion to paid subscriptions.
