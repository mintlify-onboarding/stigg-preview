## Overview

In this quick start guide we'll demonstrate how to provision customers in Stigg.

**Customers** in Stigg should be provisioned when a customer is created in your application, for example: as part of your registration or onboarding process.

  
## Before we begin

In order to complete this guide in your application code, please make sure that you have:

* [Modeled your pricing in Stigg](modeling-your-pricing)
* [Installed the Stigg Node.js server SDK](nodejs-sdk#initializing-the-sdk)
* [A Stigg **server** API key](nodejs-sdk#retrieving-the-server-api-key)
  
## Initializing the server SDK

The first step is to initialize Stigg's server SDK with the server API key of the environment that's integrated with Stigg:

TypeScript

`import Stigg from '@stigg/node-server-sdk';

const stiggClient = await Stigg.initialize({ apiKey: 'YOUR_SERVER_API_KEY' });

export default stiggClient;
`

> ## ðŸš§
> 
> The Stigg SDK instance has an internal cache and supports retries for certain API calls on network errors. In general, you should initialize it once per process (for example: using a singleton design-pattern) and use the same instance throughout the codebase.

  
## Provision a customer

When a new customer is provisioned within your application (for example: as part of your registration or onboarding process), you should also provision them in Stigg. 

You can optionally pass `subscriptionParams` to create subscription for that customer using a single operation. Doing so, will allow Stigg admins to override the requested subscription with no-code from the Stigg Console using the [product's Customer Journey configuration](products#defining-the-customer-journey).

TypeScript

`const customer = await stiggClient.provisionCustomer({ 
    customerId: 'test-customer-id',
    name: 'My very first customer',
    email: '[[emailÂ protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)',
    subscriptionParams: {
      planId: 'plan-basic'
    }
});
`

### Excluding customers from experiment

When running experiments, in some cases we would want to exclude customer from participating in the experiment. For example if we have a marketing campaign for new users that creates new subscriptions to specific plans. We will need to use the `excludeFromExperiment` flag. In case the flag is provided, customer will have the subscription according to the customer journey.

TypeScript

`const customer = await stiggClient.provisionCustomer({ 
    customerId: 'test-customer-id',
    name: 'My very first customer',
    email: '[[emailÂ protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)',
 	  excludeFromExperiment: true,
    subscriptionParams: {
      planId: 'plan-basic'
    }
});
`
