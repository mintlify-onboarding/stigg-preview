## Overview

Free trials allow your customers to try your product and see value during a limited time period before they need to make a purchase decision, which can help increase customer adoption and conversion.

Stigg allows you add a free trial to your product without requiring additional code changes in your application.

## Trial types

1. **Credit card trial** \- customers start a free trial after they provide a credit card. At the end of the trial customers are automatically converted to a paid subscription.
2. **Free trial** \- customers can start a free trial without needing to enter a credit card. If customers don't convert at the end of the trial period, they lose access to the products' features.
3. **Reverse trial** \- customers start in a free trial of a paid plan. If customers don't convert at the end of the trial period, they're automatically downgraded to a free plan.
