## Overview

The Embed SDK is a Javascript library for presenting Stigg components in websites that are created using Webflow, Wordpress, or plain HTML.

Under the hood, the Embed SDK wraps the [React SDK](react-sdk) and allows you to inject the same components into your website without needing to include any additional frameworks.

## Installing the SDK

To include the Embed SDK in the page, you need to add the following `<script>` tag to the `<body> `element:

HTML

`<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@stigg/embed-sdk@latest/dist/embed-sdk.js"></script>
`

You also need to include the styles in the `<head>` tag:

HTML

`<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@stigg/embed-sdk@latest/dist/embed-sdk.css" />
`

## Retrieving the client API key

In the Stigg Cloud Console, go to [Settings > Account > Environments](https://app.stigg.io/account/settings).

Copy the   **Client API key** of the relevant environment.

## Getting started

You'll need to initialize the Embed SDK with your API key. For the list of additional parameters that can be passed please refer to the React SDK's `<StiggProvider/>` component.

HTML

`<script>
  const stigg = Stigg({ apiKey: "YOUR-CLIENT-API-KEY" });
</script>
`
