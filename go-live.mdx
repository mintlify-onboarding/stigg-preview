title: "Going live"

When you're ready to go live, ensure that you perform all of the actions in the below checklist:

* Create a dedicated Stigg environment for production (see Selecting the integration environment).
* Copy your product catalog settings to the production environment (see Setting up your product catalog).
* Update your codebase to use the Stigg production server and client API keys when running in your production environment.
* If you integrated Stigg with a third-party business application, configure the integration in the Stigg production environment and ensure that the integration is made against the **production** instance of the third-party solution.
