title: "Accessible from anywhere"
---

Stigg's API is globally scalable and highly available by leveraging a content delivery network (CDN), where our code is executed at a location (regional edge) closest to the user. This means our services are accessible from anywhere in the world without compromising performance and latency. Due to the nature of this function-as-a-service (FaaS) architecture, our API can handle a large volume of concurrent requests by automatically scaling up and allocating new functions as much as needed.

Leveraging the CDN for improved performance and latency

When accessing entitlement, usage, and catalog data through our API, the reads are performed on pre-calculated data that is stored in a distributed cache and is automatically replicated across multiple regions. It allows us to achieve lightning-fast read response times and improves our APIs overall availability. The cache is kept up-to-date by recalculating the data on every customer subscription update and catalog modification.
