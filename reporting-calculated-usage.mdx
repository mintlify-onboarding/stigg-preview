title: "Reporting calculated usage"
---

## Overview

When calculated usage is reported to Stigg, **your application** is responsible for aggregating and calculating the usage and then reporting it to Stigg.

## Supported ingestion behaviors

Stigg supports 2 behaviors for reporting calculated usage:

1. **Delta** \- the reported usage represents the **change** in usage of the feature, for example: when a customer adds 2 more seats, the reported value should be 2\. This is default behavior.
2. **Set** \- the reported usage represents the **end state** after the change, for example: when a customer adds 2 more seats and the total number of seats after the change is 5, the reported value should be 5.

## Example use-case

### Seats

When a customer invites additional users to their environment, report the number of new seats that were added to Stigg.

Similarly, when a customer removes users from their environment report the number of seats that were removed from the environment to Stigg.

### Bandwidth

Periodically query the infrastructure that tracks used bandwidth (for example: AWS CloudWatch) and report the calculated usage to Stigg.
