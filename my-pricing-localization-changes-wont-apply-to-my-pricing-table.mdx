title: "My pricing localization changes won't apply to my pricing table"
---

You've been trying to localize your pricing to a certain country by passing `billingCountryCode` but the result is not displayed on the pricing page. In that case, it is possible that you have overwritten the text using [Text Overrides](/docs/pricing-table#texts).

Text Overrides allow you to customize the default text when setting price localization.

To revert that, go to `textOverrides` and make sure that `textOverrides.price.free` doesn't have a value overriding the default text.
