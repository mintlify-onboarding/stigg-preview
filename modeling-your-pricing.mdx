* **Products** represents a product family or business line that you offer to your customers - products are composed of plans and add-ons.
* **Plans** and **add-ons** define the way that you package and monetize your product's functionality - plans and add-ons have a price and a set of features that customers are entitled for when they purchase a subscription to them.
* **Features** are the most basic building block of the Stigg platform, and represent configurable functionality in your application that can be monetized.
* **Coupons** can be used to grant customers discounts.

## Before we begin

Stigg supports the creation of multiple environments in each account in order to support your existing product development process. Every environment is **isolated** from one another.

Select the environment that will be used for the initial integration of Stigg with your application.

We recommend first integrating Stigg with a **development** or **staging** environment.

<Note>

**When a new environment is created, a default product for that environment will be automatically created. The product name will be the same name as the account name, for example: if your account name is "Acme", an "Acme" product will automatically be created in every newly created environment.**

You can edit the name of the default product, or even remove it altogether and create a new one.
