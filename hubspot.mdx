## Overview

[HubSpot](https://www.hubspot.com)â€™s CRM platform has all the tools and integrations you need for marketing, sales, content management, and customer service.

Stigg's native integration with HubSpot enables automatic propagation of changes from the Stigg platform to HubSpot, including: changes to the product catalog (product, plans and add-ons), customers and subscriptions.

  
## Entity mapping

Stigg entities are mapped to HubSpot entities as follows:

| Stigg entity | HubSpot entity   |
| ------------ | ---------------- |
| Feature      | N/A              |
| Product      | N/A              |
| Plan         | Product          |
| Add-on       | Product          |
| Coupon       | N/A              |
| Customer     | Contact, Company |
| Subscription | Deal             |

## Setting up the integration

In the [Stigg app](%F0%9F%94%97), under the **Settings > Integrations > Apps** section, select the HubSpot connector.

Click "Connect with HubSpot".

You'll be redirected to HubSpot in order to complete the integration process.

If needed, sign in to HubSpot.

If you have access to multiple HubSpot accounts, select the account that will be integrated with Stigg.

When asked, grant Stigg the permissions in HubSpot that are required for the integration.

Once all of the integration steps on the HubSpot side are completed, you'll be redirected back to Stigg.

  
## Indication for synced entities

In the [Stigg app](%F0%9F%94%97), entities that are synced from Stigg to HubSpot have a clickable "CRM ID" property with a HubSpot logo next to it and indication of their sync status (successful, failed, [will not be synced](#entities-that-are-not-synced-to-hubspot)).

When attempting to add or edit entities that are synced to HubSpot, there will be an indication that the change will also be reflected HubSpot.

  
## Accessing HubSpot entities from Stigg

In the [Stigg app](%F0%9F%94%97), clicking on the link of the "CRM ID" property will open the relevant entity in HubSpot.

> ## ðŸ“˜
> 
> Due to the fact that HubSpot doesn't support direct deep-links to entities in the HubSpot product catalog, attempting to access synced **plans** and **add-ons** from the Stigg app will only open the HubSpot product catalog, and not the specific entity inside the product catalog.

## Known limitations

1. The integration currently only supports propagation of data from Stigg to HubSpot, and not the other way around. Specifically, when a deal is closed in HubSpot, it's not currently possible to link it to a subscription in Stigg.
2. All deals are currently synced to the **default sales pipeline**.
3. When a plan's or add-on's price is updated in Stigg and the change is set to affect **existing customers**, the deal amount of existing customers in HubSpot is not automatically updated.
4. When customers are subscribed to a usage-based plan, the deal amount in HubSpot is **not** currently updated according to the customer usage and will remain at 0.
