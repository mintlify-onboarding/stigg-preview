title: "High availability architecture"
---

Stigg's mission is to create a reliable and highly available solution that won't interrupt the mission-critical functionality of your application. To make sure that the critical paths are not affected, in case of a network error or if our services are unavailable for any reason, we have a few guardrails in place.

We prioritized the following SDK functions as "mission-critical":

* Accessing customer entitlements (P95 latency of 100ms)
* Reporting usage measurements (P95 latency of 200ms)
