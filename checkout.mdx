## Overview

The Stigg checkout widget allows you to easily accept payments without ever worrying about changes to your pricing model or migration to another billing provider.

Using only a few lines of code you can offer customers a cart-like experience where they can configure their plans, add and remove add-ons and apply promo codes.

Stigg's checkout widget is optimized for SaaS and includes built-in support for advanced use-cases, such as multiple billable metrics, volume pricing, pay-as-you-go pricing, scheduled downgrades, downgrade to free, handling of prorations, and grandfathering.

The widget can be embedded directly into your application's UI, in a modal or even a completely separate page.

Once integrated into your applications, changes to pricing and styling in the Stigg app are auto-magically reflected in the widget.

## Checkout widget sections

### Plan configuration

In this section customers can configure the subscription of their **plan**, specifically:

1. Billing period - when a plan allows both monthly and annual billing period
2. Charges - when the plan pricing allows customers to select the quantity that they want to commit to. For example: the seat quantity

### Add-ons

In this section customers can purchase add-ons, update the purchased quantity or remove them altogether in a self-served manner.

This section will only appear when there are add-ons that are compatible with the selected plan.

### Payment details

In this section customers can enter their payment details, specifically:

1. Billing address
2. Credit card details

Customers that have entered payment details in the past can choose to pay using the same payment details, or enter new ones.

Payment details can later be updated from the [customer portal](customer-portal#payment-details).

![](/images/a6d5413-Screenshot_2023-09-12_at_3.50.30.png) 

> ## ðŸ“˜
> 
> Stigg does **not** store any payment details (billing address, credit card information) - they're stored directly in the billing solution that's integrated with Stigg.

### Order summary

The order summary appears on the right side of the checkout widget, and is visible throughout the checkout session.

The summary provide visibility for the following information:

1. Plan charges
2. Add-ons and their cost
3. Discounts (when applicable) - including the ability to enter promotion codes
4. Tax rates (when applicable)
5. Total subscription price after discounts and taxes
6. Prorated amount due today (when applicable)
7. Applied credits (when applicable)
8. Price amount due today
9. Summary foot note  
   1. Number of credits granted to the customer due to the change, for example: in the case of [immediate downgrades](subscription-updates-in-stigg#downgrades-between-paid-plans)  
   2. Indication when updates to subscriptions will take place if they don't take effect immediately, for example in the case of [scheduled downgrades](subscription-updates-in-stigg#scheduled-downgrades)  
   3. Indication when the next billing period will take place - for example: on the 4th of every month, every year on September 12th

## Rendering a checkout session

### Prerequisites

> ## ðŸš§
> 
> To render a checkout session, Stigg must be integrated with a billing solution such as [Stripe](stripe)

To render pricing tables inside your application, when a customer signs-in or restores their session set the customer ID:

ReactVue.js

`import { useStiggContext } from '@stigg/react-sdk';

function App() {
  const { stigg } = useStiggContext();

  useEffect(() => {
    // after user sign in call to setCustomerId
    stigg.setCustomerId('<LOGGED_IN_CUSTOMER_ID>');
  })
}
`

`<script setup lang="ts">
import {StiggProvider} from '@stigg/vue-sdk';

const apiKey = "<STIGG_CLIENT_API_KEY>";
const customerId = "<LOGGED_IN_CUSTOMER_ID>";
</script>

<template>
   <StiggProvider :apiKey="apiKey" :customerId="customerId">
      <NestedComponents />
   </StiggProvider>
</template>
`

### Plan upgrade or downgrade

To initiate a checkout session for plan upgrade or downgrade, simply pass the **target** plan ID when rendering the checkout widget.

ReactVue.js

`<Checkout
        planId={"<TARGET_PLAN_ID>"}
        onCheckoutCompleted={({ success, error }) => {
          // TODO: handle checkout completion
        }}
      />
`

`<script setup lang="ts">
import { Checkout, CheckoutProps } from "@stigg/vue-sdk";

const checkout: CheckoutProps = {
  planId: "<TARGET_PLAN_ID>",
  onCheckoutCompleted: async ({ success, error }) => {
    // TODO: handle checkout completion
  },
};
</script>

<template>
	<Checkout v-bind="checkout" />
</template>
`

### Updating an existing subscription

To allow customers update their subscription to an existing plan, for example:

1. Change billing period
2. Add or remove seats
3. Purchase add-ons

Simply pass the **current plan ID** when rendering the checkout widget:

ReactVue.js

`<Checkout
        planId={"<CURRENT_PLAN_ID>"}
        onCheckoutCompleted={({ success, error }) => {
          // TODO: handle checkout completion
        }}
      />
`

`<script setup lang="ts">
import { Checkout, CheckoutProps } from "@stigg/vue-sdk";

const checkout: CheckoutProps = {
  planId: "<CURRENT_PLAN_ID>",
  onCheckoutCompleted: async ({ success, error }) => {
    // TODO: handle checkout completion
  },
};
</script>

<template>
	<Checkout v-bind="checkout" />
</template>
`

### Tax calculation

#### Automatically using Stripe Tax

When Stigg is [integrated with Stripe Tax](stripe#integration-with-stripe-tax), subscription tax rate are automatically calculated by Stripe according to the customer billing address.

#### Via integration with third-party tax providers

The Stigg Checkout widget can be integrated with third-party tax providers such as Avalara to preview and collect tax amounts.

##### Previewing the estimated tax amount

To preview customers with the estimated tax rates under the widget's "order summary" section:

1. Handle the `onBillingAddressChange` callback.
2. In the callback:  
   1. Pass the customer's billing address to the third-party tax vendor.  
   2. Set the tax rate that was returned by the third-party tax vendor as the widget's `billingInformation.taxDetails.taxPercentage` property.

##### Collecting taxes

Tax collection takes place in the **backend** when new subscriptions are provisioned and existing subscriptions are updated. To collect taxes, follow the below steps:

**In the frontend:**

1. Handle the `onCheckout` callback.
2. In the callback send the `checkoutParams` and `customerId` to your backend.

**In the backend:**

1. Retrieve the customer's billing address from the `checkoutParams.billingInformation.billingAddress` object.
2. Pass the customer's billing address to the third-party tax vendor for calculation of the tax rate.
3. At the tax percentage that was calculated by the third-party tax vendor to the `checkoutParams` object under under the `checkoutParams.billingInformation.taxPercentage` property.
4. Call the `applySubscription` method of the Stigg backend SDK with the following parameters:  
   1. The `checkoutParams` object, that now includes the `checkoutParams.billingInformation.taxPercentage` property.  
   2. The `customerId` parameter from the checkout widget.

**In the frontend (again ðŸ™ƒ):**

Return the result of the `applySubscription` method invocation to the `onCheckout` callback.

ReactVue.js

`` <Checkout
        planId={"<TARGET_PLAN_ID>"}
        onBillingAddressChange={async ({ billingAddress })=> {
          // pass the customer's billing address to the third-party tax provider
          const taxPercentage = await taxProvider.calculate(billingAddress);
          
          // set the tax percentage state
          setCalculatedTaxPercentage(taxPercentage);
        }}
        
        // calculated tax should be provided in `billingInformation`
        // used only for previewing the subscription fees
        billingInformation={{ taxDetails: { taxPercentage: calculatedTaxPercentage } }}
        
        onCheckout={async ({ customerId, checkoutParams }) => {
          // TODO: 
          // 1. Send checkoutParams & customerId to backend to securely calculate
          // the tax using the `billingAddress` field on the `checkoutParams.billingInformation`
          // 2. call `applySubscription` method using the Stigg backend SDK
          // 3. return the `applySubscription` method results to the `onCheckout` method
          
          return applySubscriptionResults;
        }}
        onCheckoutCompleted={({ success, error }) => {
          // TODO: handle checkout completion
        }}
      />
 ``

`` <script setup lang="ts">
import { Checkout, CheckoutProps } from "@stigg/vue-sdk";
import { ref } from "vue";

const calculatedTaxPercentage = ref();

const checkout: CheckoutProps = {
  planId: "<TARGET_PLAN_ID>",

  onBillingAddressChange: async ({ billingAddress }) => {
    // pass the customer's billing address to the third-party tax provider
    const taxPercentage = await taxProvider.calculate(billingAddress);

    // set the tax percentage state
    calculatedTaxPercentage.value = taxPercentage;
  },

  // calculated tax should be provided in `billingInformation`
  // used only for previewing the subscription fees
  billingInformation: {
    taxDetails: { taxPercentage: calculatedTaxPercentage.value },
  },

  onCheckout: async ({ customerId, checkoutParams }) => {
    // TODO:
    // 1. Send checkoutParams & customerId to backend to securely calculate
    // the tax using the `billingAddress` field on the `checkoutParams.billingInformation`
    // 2. call `applySubscription` method using the Stigg backend SDK
    // 3. return the `applySubscription` method results to the `onCheckout` method

    return applySubscriptionResults;
  },

  onCheckoutCompleted: async ({ success, error }) => {
    // TODO: handle checkout completion
  },
};
</script>

<template>
  <Checkout v-bind="checkout" />
</template>

## Special cases

### Immediate downgrades

When customers attempt to reduce their subscription cost (for example by selecting a lower tier, reducing seat or add-on quantity, or changing their billing period from annual to monthly) and will receive credits for unused time on their current subscription configuration, a footnote that includes the amount of credits granted will appear under the [order summary section](#order-summary).

![](/images/ee48d99-Screenshot_2023-09-12_at_4.08.00.png) 

[ ![](/images/49580f8-arrows_counterclockwise.png)  Immediate downgrades Subscriptions in Stigg ](subscription-updates-in-stigg#immediate-downgrades) 

### Scheduled downgrades

When customers attempt to reduce their subscription cost (for example by selecting a lower tier, reducing seat or add-on quantity, or changing their billing period from annual to monthly) and the changes will be applied at the end of the billing period, a footnote that includes the amount of credits granted will appear under the [order summary section](#order-summary).

### Downgrades to a free plan

When customers attempt to downgrade from a paid subscription to a free one, a dedicated view will be presented to the customer indicating that they're about to cancel their paid subscription:

## Multiple subscriptions for the same product

## Customization

### No-code widget designer

The Stigg app offers a no-code widget designer, which allows you to control the widget colors, typography, layout and whether customer phone numbers will be collected.

### Phone number collection

Collection of customer phone numbers can sometimes be useful when trying to upsell self-service customers to sales-led enterprise plans.

The checkout widget can be configured whether or not to collect customer's phone numbers upon checkout using the "Content" section the no-code widget designer in the Stigg app.

### Custom CSS

For more advanced customization, custom CSS can be applied using the widget designer of the Stigg app. Alternatively, custom CSS can also be applied using code.
