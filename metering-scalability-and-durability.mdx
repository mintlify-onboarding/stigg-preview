## Scalability

Stigg's metering and aggregation capabilities are designed from the ground up for managing high-volume real-time use cases:

* The Stigg API and SDKs allow you to report usage events in batches, with up to 1000 events per batch.
* Usage events can be reported in parallel from multiple distributed reporters without requiring any coordination.
* Built-in idempotency guarantees that duplicate events are only reported once.
* Current usage is accessed from a [distributed cache](/docs/accessible-from-everywhere) and is automatically replicated across multiple regions.
* [Local caching](/docs/local-caching-and-fallback-strategy) allows you to access reported usage without needing to make a call over the network.

## Durability and recovery

Reported usage events are stored in their original format in a highly available persistent data store with 99.999999999% of durability. This is allows you to rebuild usage data from scratch at any point in time if needed.
