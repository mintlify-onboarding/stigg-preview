title: "Add-ons"

## Overview

Add-ons represent separately billable functionality that extends specific plans. As opposed to plans, customers can purchase multiple units of a specific add-on.

Add-ons are dependent on the life-cycle of the plan that they extend; that is, when a subscription expires, customers also lose access to the plan’s add-ons.

The functionality that’s included in each add-on is defined by a combination of features and their configuration (referred to as entitlements).

Due to the fact that add-ons extend the functionality of plans, when customers purchase a subscription that includes both plans and add-ons that are defined using the same configuration or metered features, the value of each feature that customers will be entitled to will be the **sum** of the entitlements of that specific feature. For example: if a customer has a subscription for a plan, and as part of that plan they’re entitled to X units of a specific feature. If they’ll also purchase an add-on with Y units of the same feature, the customer will be entitled to X + Y units as part of their subscription. Moreover, if the customers pays for a quantity of Q add-ons as part of their subscription, they’ll be entitled to X + Y \* Q units of that feature.

## Creating add-ons

To add an add-on, click on the "+ Add" button under the Add-ons section of the selected product.  
Enter the below details in the opened modal:

1. Name - the name of the add-on.
2. ID - will be auto-generated by Stigg. Use this ID to refer to the add-on in your application. To link an existing add-on, override the auto-generated value.
3. Description (optional) - the add-on's description.

> ## 📘
> 
> The values that are entered in the “Name” and “Description” fields will be leveraged by Stigg to render the customer-facing paywall and customer portal; therefore, it’s recommended to use customer-friendly texts.

Confirm the action by clicking on the "Create" button.

New add-ons are created as drafts. Add-ons must be published in order to be visible to customers and be included in subscriptions.

> ## 🚧
> 
> Before publishing an add-on, make sure to [assign features](add-ons#assigning-features-to-add-ons) to the add-on and define its [pricing](add-ons#defining-the-add-ons-price).

## Defining the add-on's price

The price that's defined in Stigg will be shown to customers in the pricing tables that are rendered using Stigg's SDKs.

When Stigg is integrated with a billing solution (for example: [Stripe](stripe)), subscriptions will be created in the billing solution using the price that was defined in Stigg.

Click on the "Set" button under the Pricing section of the selected add-on.

The first step would be to select the add-on type - paid or custom (free add-ons are not currently supported).

![](/images/b09f231-Screenshot_2023-07-20_at_11.55.17.png) 

### Paid add-ons

Paid add-ons in Stigg are intended to be used in order to allow your customers to subscribe to your product in a self-served manner.

When an add-on is defined as a "Paid" plan, additional information is required.

To set an add-on as "Paid", select "Paid" as the add-on type and click "Continue".

* To grant free add-ons, simply set the price of the add-ons to $0.

#### Billing period

The allowed intervals that customers will be billed at - monthly, annual or both.

When customers subscribe to this plan, the billing period will also serve as subscription's commitment length - when customers update their subscription or cancel it altogether they'll be compensated in time or money according to the remaining time in the current billing period.

#### Charges

Charges refer to the line items that customers will be billed for when subscribing to this add-on.

Currently, only a recurring fixed fee is supported.

Enter the charge amount in US dollars in each of the allowed billing periods. Defining prices in other currencies can be done later by leveraging Stigg's [price localization ](price-localization)capabilities.

Click "Continue".

### Custom add-ons

Custom add-ons are intended to be used when the price and content of subscriptions is negotiated with each customer and therefore varies between different customers, as is usually the case in sales-led opportunities.

Since add-ons extend plans, subscriptions to custom add-ons must also include a [custom plan](plans#custom-plans). When Stigg is integrated with a billing solution, subscriptions that include custom plans and add-ons will not be created in the billing solution.

To set an ad-don as "Custom", select "Custom" as the add-on type and click "Continue".

## Assigning features to add-ons

The functionality that’s included in each add-on is defined by a combination of features and their configuration, referred to in Stigg as entitlements.

To add entitlements to an add-on, click on the "+ Add" button under the Entitlements section of the selected add-on.

Search for the features that you'd like to assign to the add-on and select them from the list.

Apply the relevant configuration for the selected features:

1. **Configuration features** must be defined with the configuration value.
2. **Metered features** can be defined with a limit or without one. Stigg can optionally automatically reset the measured usage every predefined period (monthly, weekly, daily, or hourly). This can be useful for representing features, such as number of API calls per month.

Confirm the action by clicking on the "Add" button.

## Storing metadata

It's possible to store metadata on each add-on. The metadata can then be leveraged by the hosting application and third-party solutions via the Stigg SDKs, API and webhooks to implement custom functionality.

To store metadata on a specific add-on, under the "Metadata" section of selected add-on click on the "Add" (if there's no metadata) or "Edit" buttons.

Enter the relevant keys and values.

Click "Add" (if there was previously no metadata) or "Save changes" buttons to apply the changes.

## Publishing add-ons

After defining the basic details, entitlements and pricing of draft add-ons, publish the add-on.

To do so, click on the "Publish" button in the add-on's header.

After the add-on is published, make sure to [mark it as compatible with the relevant plans](add-ons#defining-add-on-compatibility-with-specific-plans) in order to allow customers to create subscriptions that include a combination of the plan with the compatible add-on.

## Defining add-on compatibility with specific plans

Defining add-ons as "compatible" with specific plans represents the fact that the add-on can extend that plan. If an add-on is not compatible with a specific plan, it will not be possible to create a subscription that includes the plan and the incompatible add-on.

To mark an add-on as compatible with a specific plan:

1. Select the relevant plan that you'd like to make the add-on compatible with from the **Plans** sub-section of the Product Catalog.
2. If the plan was already published, first edit it.
3. Under the **Compatible Add-ons** section click on "+ Add".
4. Select the relevant add-ons in the opened modal.
5. Confirm the action by clicking on the "Add" button.

> ## 📘
> 
> When an add-on is compatible with a plan, all **versions** of that add-on will be compatible with that plan.

## Editing published add-ons

Stigg's allows product managers and growth team members to make frequent and rapid changes to add-ons without requiring additional engineering changes.

Changes can be rolled out to both existing and new subscriptions (for example: when adding or removing an entitlement from an add-on), or only to new subscriptions (for example: when changing the add-on's price).

Stigg uses a versioning mechanism to support this functionality - every time an add-on is edited a new version is created. Changes to the add-on can be published or discarded.

To edit an add-on, click on the dotted menu icon of the relevant add-on, and select the "Edit" action.

Apply the relevant changes to the add-on.

> ## 📘
> 
> Some properties of an add-on (for example: its ID), cannot be modified after the add-on is created.

#### Reviewing changes

To review the changes to the add-on since the last published add-on version, click on "review changes" or "Review & publish" in the add-on's header.

In the change review modal:

1. **Green** backgrounds represent items that were **added** since the last published version.
2. **Orange** backgrounds represent items that were **updated** since the last published version.
3. **Red** backgrounds represent items that were **removed** since the last published version.
  
#### Publishing changes

> ## 📘
> 
> Changes must first be reviewed before they can be published.

To publish changes, in the change review modal select the target audience to which the changes will be applied:

1. **New subscriptions** \- the changes will only affect subscriptions that are created after the new add-on version is published.
2. **Both existing and new subscriptions** \- in addition to (1), existing active subscriptions will be migrated to use the new add-on version.

When applying changes also to existing subscriptions, an acknowledgment of a series of disclaimers is required.

> ## 🚧
> 
> Default grandfathering of subscription pricing when rolling out pricing changes
> 
> Pricing changes are automatically published only to new subscriptions. Existing subscriptions can be migrated to the latest price [manually using the Stigg UI](/docs/subscriptions#migrating-subscriptions-to-the-latest-plan-or-add-on-version) or [programmatically](graphql-api#migrating-subscriptions-to-the-latest-plan-and-add-on-version).

To discard pending changes from an add-on, click on "Discard changes" in the add-on's header.

Confirm the action in the opened dialog.

## Deleting add-ons

To delete an add-on, click on the dotted menu icon of the relevant add-on, and select the "Delete" action.

Confirm the action by clicking on the "Delete" button in the opened modal.
